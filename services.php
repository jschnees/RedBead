          <span class="emphasis">
            Ashtanga is a system 
            of yoga originally transmitted
            by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois of Mysore, India. 
            The system is now transmitted by his grandson, Sharath Jois. 
          </span>

            The Ashtanga system is designed to purify the body, promote proper functioning of the digestive system,
            build strength, and restore range of motion to the body. The method of practice taught in Ashtanga Yoga relies on
            linking postures with deep, even breathing and steady gazing with the eyes. The system of linking the breath with movement
            is known as vinyasa and encourages the blood to circulate properly allowing the removal of unwanted toxins. The gazing point
            helps to facilitate a state of meditation, having a profound effect on the steadiness of the mind.

                During counseling, you can expect an initial assessment to identify issues and to establish 
                personal goals. Next, we'll explore your existing strengths and support system. From counseling, 
                you may be referred to a psychiatrist or for other treatment.

              If you find yourself answering yes to many of these questions, then perhaps is the time to start changing your
              future and start finding out the reasons why. We spend way too much of our lives in our jobs to be unhappy
              and unfulfilled; often playing a large role in depression and anxiety as an adult. Furthermore, with
              the economy being so competitive, job interviews are becoming even harder to come by, let alone succeed in.
            </p>
            <p>
                With many employees being savvier than ever before in knowing what it takes to get ahead in a company,
                it is becoming even more difficult to get promoted and the competition is for those positions are more competitive to get.
                To be competitive in this job market you must be operating at your peak potential.
                Companies have been coaching executives and senior level managers for years but that level of personal
                coaching for the average worker is virtually non-existent.
            </p>
            <p>
                We understand the need for this level of coaching for the average worker and we offer performance assessment
                and coaching services that meets your needs and finances. Based on our executive assessment experience,
                We provide inside knowledge to what major companies look for in a potential candidate as well as what behaviors they
                look for in identifying employees for leadership development. We offer assessment services that help provide information
                about your personality, communication styles, and interests. Assessment services also can include 360 degree
                feedback from supervisors, co-workers, and subordinates to help understand how other people are viewing you (where possible).
            </p>
            <p>
                Assessment results are then used to coach the clients to help them live up to their potential and to provide
                feedback on how to present yourself in the manner in which you intend.
