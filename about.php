            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>
              In the early 90s there was a small health and wellness movement. Yoga and meditation 
              were starting to become a popularized ideology. <br />
              A private investor who wishes to remain anonymous bought into the movement  
              and wanted to invest a small fortune to create a company that connected people 
              with the movement. The investor also happened to be a boat aficionado. 
              The company decided to take that small fortune and buy a boat. 
              Not just any boat but a small cruise vessel.  <br />
              They named it and their company The Red Bead. 
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">
              The Red Bead is named after a special bead on sacred bracelet the investor was 
              gifted by monks while studying meditation in the Himalayas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Red Bead was formally founded in the year 1990 with the primary mission 
              to bring people together from all walks of life to help them overcome their barriers 
              and achieve their goals. 
              We bring together the best people with the cutting edge techniques in therapy, 
              health services and life goal achievement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our first year was a major failure. We were the right market but at the wrong time. 
              We had meager sales and interest in our services. We didnâ€™t know our market. 
              We created some focus groups and consulted leaders in the fields of health & wellness 
              and set our sails in a new direction.
            </p>  
            <p>
              We bounced back in our next year with our first cruise. While not achieving our sales goals, 
              we did lead a successful and healthy cruise.
              The following  years we have seen an exponential growth. Each year has been more successful and more rewarding than the last. </p>
            </p>
            <p class="emphasis">  
              We continue to help people achieve their goals and overcome their obstacles each and every sunrise.
